    <div class="biography">
        <p>Hello, my name is Arav Arora, a first-year computer science student from Littleton, MA. I have a keen interest in coding and am particularly passionate about being a volunteer soccer coach. It brings me joy to contribute to the community, using my soccer knowledge to mentor young athletes. I find great fulfillment in this pursuit. Additionally, I've been coaching soccer teams since I was in 10th grade, and I was even a head coach in my senior year. I've racked over <span class="highlight">250</span> hours of community service as a soccer coach, and I hope to continue to grow and develop in the future. In particular, I enjoy organizing <span class="highlight">soccer clinics</span> that focus on teamwork and leadership skills!</p>
